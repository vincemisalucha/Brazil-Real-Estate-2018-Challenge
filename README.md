# Brazil-Real-Estate-2018-Challenge
A 2021 internship challenge from Thinking Machines to perform EDA and additional applied knowledge on a Brazil Real Estate dataset from a public table in BigQuery.

## About the Data
<br> Dataset origin: properati-data-public.properties_br
<br> Time Frame: Jan. 2015 to Feb. 2018

## Contents
1.) Exploratory Data Analysis - can be found in the powerpoint file along with the drawn conclusions.

2.) Inter Active Folium Map for Apartments and Houses for Sale

3.) Neural Network Regression - predicting the price of the property. Trained from the Feb. 2018 data and located in BR_NN_Regression.ipynb. This is intended for possible listers wishing to gauge the value of their property.
<br> Limitation and Recommendations: One notable limitation stems from time constraints, as the model was trained without the ability to incorporate the entire dataset as a time series. To enhance its performance and applicability to temporal patterns, future iterations should consider dedicating more time to training on the complete dataset.
